# NutMeg
First decent soccer website

# Goals/Motivations
  * Love Soccer, no better way to demonstrate my progess than through building something I am passionate about
  * Application of newer technologies in my arsenal: Material UI, Less, Fetch React
  * Passionate about making something clean, something that defines me, primarily something that I am super proud of
  * Single page app fam
  * Backup plan: Switch Sports :(
  
# Initial Key Features
  * Teams and Players (Premier League initially)
  * Player stats
  * Daily News
  * Daily prayers that all of this info actually has API's for them 
  
# Key Struggles
  * Spent hours looking for ideal accessible Soccer APIs - Try SportDeer -- free until 2019!
  * implementing Async/Await with fetch in componentDidMount instead of .then wasn't too bad actually
  * Being able to navigate through a codebase proved to be essential for jumping into Material UI and integrating it with my design.
  * Routing - be wary Material UI uses a switch to check through routes so must have nested routes come before more general routes. However I feel as if exact path was used instead of just path I would not have had this issue. (Will look more into this later)
  
  
  * Getting the data I want from this jargin, may implement my own backend in the future to address these issues
